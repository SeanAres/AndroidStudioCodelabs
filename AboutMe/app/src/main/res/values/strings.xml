    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Sean.
        \n\nI like to draw, read, watch film, take photos, buy clothes, and play video games.
\n\nI draw people so I can create characters, draw people I see, and create clothing for them
\nI buy a lot of old expensive clothes, it is a problem
\n\nI am into art and literature of all kinds.
        \nI read and watch a lot of content that I become obsessed with. If I am into something I REALLY get into it.
\n\nGaming wise I have only really been playing Genshin Impact but I used to compete in FPS games
\n\nI have been trying to learn how to be more proficient with film cameras and Japanese
\n\nIf we have any common interests be my friend.\n\n</string>
